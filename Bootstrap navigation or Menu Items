Hi,

Can you please help me in finding solution for the below situation:
1) Navigation items(Menu items) collapse as the screen size is reduced in laptop, however when the same is seen in 
mobile phone the navigation is not collapsing.
2) The image shown in the website looks Good in laptop, however there is a white strip seen at RHS, 
how to remove this white strip so the image is seen
3) By default the footer is at the bottom of the screen, which works good in the laptop, however as I see the same in 
mobile phone the footer is shown at the bottom, as we scroll till the end of the website.

Thanks in advance,
Vasanth
